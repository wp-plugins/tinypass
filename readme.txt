TinyPass is the best way to charge for access to content on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

TinyPass is a simple, powerful service that allows any online publisher to easily accept quick and secure payments for access to any type of content. TinyPass can process payments as small as 10 cents, and doesn't require changing your site's existing structure or layout.

You can use TinyPass to charge for access to a single post or a bundle of posts. TinyPass also allows you to offer discounts to those visitors who choose to purchase multiple posts.

== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress dashboard, go to Plugins->Add New and either upload TinyPass (if you've already downloaded the plugin), or search for the TinyPass plugin within WordPress and simply click "install".

2. If you haven't already, go to http://tinypass.com/home/publishers/register to create a free publisher account and to register your initial application. (An application is the category of content that you want to charge for using TinyPass, e.g. the recipe section of your WordPress food blog.)

3. In your WordPress dashboard, go to TinyPass->Settings. Under Application IDs and Keys you will see four fields. 

  -- The first two fields are auto-generated by TinyPass and correspond to your "Sandbox" environment. The Sandbox allows you to test the TinyPass experience and to see how TinyPass will appear to your audience without actually processing any payments.

  -- The second two fields are "Live" and are meant to be used once you are ready to begin accepting payments. In order to begin accepting payments, enter the AID and secret key that were generated when you registered your application with TinyPass. Those values can be found in the "Applications" section of your publisher account at www.TinyPass.com.

4. In TinyPass->Settings, checking "TinyPass Enabled" will turn TinyPass on for your entire site. This is an easy way to manage TinyPass at a global level. If "TinyPass Enabled" is NOT checked, any content you've protected with TinyPass will become free to access. 

5. Make sure to switch from "Sandbox" to "Production" in TinyPass->Settings when you're ready to start accepting payments.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is TinyPass? =

TinyPass is a flexible, powerful, enterprise-level paywall software platform. (We don't love the term "paywall", because it implies a binary either-you-pay-or-you're-locked-out paradigm, and TinyPass enables much more sophisticated pricing models, but it is a common industry term.) We enable publishers and content creators to charge in any amount, on their own sites, with pricing rules that they control.

= How do I use TinyPass? =

You can deploy TinyPass in one of two ways: either you can use one of our existing plug-ins for popular CMS platforms (Wordpress, Drupal and Joomla are currently available, with more on the way), or you can use our API to integrate TinyPass into another existing system. Currently we offer libraries for Java, .NET, and PHP.

= What makes TinyPass unique? =

Unlike other approaches to paid-content, TinyPass allows anyone publishing digital content to design a pay-to-access plan that won't alienate their audience. Charge at price points from 10¢ to $200, charge for as much or as little content as you want, and charge in a way that allows your audience to make quick, simple and secure payments.

= What features does TinyPass offer for WordPress users? =

Every site has different content and a unique audience. That's why TinyPass supports a variety of approaches to paid-content. The TinyPass plugin for WordPress works seamlessly with the way content is published, allowing WordPress users to easily charge for access to a single post, a bundle of posts, offer discounts to loyal visitors, and even specify when content will go from paid to free.

= Where can I learn more about using TinyPass for WordPress? =

We're glad you asked! For a complete set of instructions for working with TinyPass for WordPress, please visit www.developer.tinypass.com/main/wordpress.

= How do my visitors pay? =

TinyPass offers a quick and painless payment process that allows your visitors to use their preferred payment method (PayPal, Amazon, Google Wallet or Credit Card). There is no new account to create and no long form to fill out. Payment can be made in as little as two clicks, and visitors never leave your site during the payment process. 

= How do I get paid? =

You can track your sales and revenue in real-time in your TinyPass publisher dashboard and request payout per our terms of service, see https://tinypass.com/terms/publisher.

= What does it cost to use TinyPass? =

We pride ourselves on offering a unique and useful technology, great service, no startup cost, and a fair and transparent fee structure. We make money by deducting a small percentage of each transaction that is processed through TinyPass. Our system is purpose-built to maximize the revenue you earn while minimizing the fees you pay. In most cases, you'll get all of the services that TinyPass offers and still keep more revenue after fees than you would if you built your own system for processing transactions directly through PayPal, Amazon Payments, Google Checkout, or the major credit cards.
