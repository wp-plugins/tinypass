TinyPass is the best way to charge for access to content on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

TinyPass is a simple, powerful plugin that allows any online publisher to easily sell access to any type of content, whether it's a blog post, a site subscription, a digital download, or even a pay-per-view video. TinyPass can accept payments as small as **2 cents ($0.02)**, supports **24 currencies**, and doesn't require changing your site's existing structure or layout. We make it easy to charge for content! 

Any site, large or small, can use TinyPass to easily build a new revenue stream from paid content. And while you're still free to earn money from advertising anywhere on your site, we've seen that a simple paid content plan can quickly surpass what you can earn from advertising, even if you're only selling access to a small percentage of your site's content. And since it doesn't cost anything to get started with TinyPass, we make it easy to experiment with charging for content.  

You can use TinyPass to **charge for access to a single post or a bundle of posts**. There are no merchant accounts to create, and no hoops to jump through when it comes to getting paid. 

Selling content is **easy** with TinyPass. Just create a free publisher account at TinyPass.com, download our plugin, then decide what content you want to charge for. In minutes you can start to sell access on a per-post basis, or use our simple tagging method to build a subscription plan, offer tiers of membership, bundles of content, or simply sell access to the occasional "premium" post. 

And for your visitors, buying access to content through TinyPass couldn't be easier. We offer a **wide choice of payment methods**, we don't require your visitors to create an account before making a purchase, and all transactions happen in a quick, secure environment. Gone are the days of clunky shopping carts and confusing checkouts!

== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress dashboard, go to Plugins->Add New and either upload TinyPass (if you've already downloaded the plugin), or search for the TinyPass plugin within WordPress and simply click "install".

2. If you haven't already, go to http://tinypass.com/home/publishers/register to create a free publisher account and to register your initial application. (When using TinyPass for WordPress, you only need to register one application per site. If you'd like to use TinyPass on multiple sites but collect all the payments into one account, please contact us and we'll help you get that setup.)

3. In your WordPress dashboard, go to TinyPass->Settings. Under Application IDs and Keys you will see four fields. 

  -- The first two fields are auto-generated by TinyPass and correspond to your "Sandbox" environment. The Sandbox allows you to test the TinyPass experience and to see how TinyPass will appear to your audience without actually processing any payments.

  -- The second two fields are "Live" and are meant to be used once you are ready to begin accepting payments. In order to begin accepting payments, enter the AID and secret key that were generated when you registered your application with TinyPass. Those values can be found in the "Applications" section of your publisher account at www.TinyPass.com.

4. In TinyPass->Settings, checking "TinyPass Enabled" will turn TinyPass on for your entire site. This is an easy way to manage TinyPass at a global level. If "TinyPass Enabled" is NOT checked, any content you've protected with TinyPass will become free to access. 

5. Make sure to switch from "Sandbox" to "Production" in TinyPass->Settings when you're ready to start accepting payments.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is TinyPass? =

TinyPass is a flexible, powerful, enterprise-grade tool for selling access to any kind of digital content. We enable publishers and content creators to charge in any amount, on their own sites, with pricing rules that they control.

For WordPress, we offer a customized interface in your WordPress dashboard that takes all the hard work out of charging for access to your content. Whether you're using TinyPass to protect a blog post, charge for a pay-per-view video, or monetize your photography website, TinyPass offers a simple system for selling content that works seamlessly with WordPress. 

= So it's like a paywall? = 

We don't love the term "paywall", because it implies a binary either-you-pay-or-you're-locked-out paradigm, and TinyPass enables much more sophisticated pricing models, but it is a common industry term. So if a paywall is what you're looking for, we have lots of satisfied publishers who use TinyPass for exactly that! 

= How do I use TinyPass? =

You can deploy TinyPass in one of two ways: either you can use one of our existing plug-ins for popular CMS platforms (Wordpress, Drupal and Joomla are currently available, with more on the way), or you can use our API to integrate TinyPass into another existing system. Currently we offer libraries for Java, .NET, and PHP.

But since you're looking at TinyPass for WordPress, here's how it works: Just create a free publisher account at TinyPass.com, download our plugin, then decide what content you want to charge for. In minutes you can start to sell access on a per-post basis. Just use the simple WordPress dashboard interface to set a preview, a price, an access period, and you're done! OR, you can use our simple tagging method to build a subscription plan, offer tiers of membership, bundles of content, or simply sell access to the occasional "premium" post. 

The TinyPass plugin was designed to sell content in a way that makes sense for WordPress, and there's no need to work with any of the code if you don't want to.

= Do I need to have any merchant or payment accounts to use TinyPass? =

Nope! We think WordPress publishers should be able to sell content without jumping through payment industry hoops. So we handle all of that for you, managing relationships with PayPal, Google Checkout, Amazon, and all the major credit card processors in order to offer your visitors a wide variety of payment methods. You can log in to your publisher dashboard at TinyPass.com at anytime to track your sales in real time and request payout of your balance. 

= How much can I charge? =

You can use TinyPass to charge as little as 10¿ or as much as $200 per transaction. (Higher price points are allowed on a case-by-case basis. Just drop us a line if needed!) 

= Can I set my prices in other currencies? =

TinyPass can be used to sell access to content around the world. To support that, we make it easy to display pricing in 24 of the most popular currencies. There's a full list here: http://www.developer.tinypass.com/main/wordpress#foreign_currency

= Do you manage subscriptions? = 

Yep. With TinyPass, you can setup ongoing subscriptions to whatever content you've protected. 

= What makes TinyPass unique? =

Unlike other approaches to paid-content, TinyPass allows anyone publishing digital content to design a pay-to-access plan that won't alienate their audience. Charge at price points from 10¿ to $200, charge for as much or as little content as you want, and charge in a way that allows your audience to make quick, simple and secure payments.

= What features does TinyPass offer for WordPress users? =

Every site has different content and a unique audience. That's why TinyPass supports a variety of approaches to paid-content. The TinyPass plugin for WordPress works seamlessly with the way content is published, allowing WordPress users to easily charge for access to a single post, a bundle of posts, offer discounts to loyal visitors, and even specify when content will go from paid to free.

= Where can I learn more about using TinyPass for WordPress? =

We're glad you asked! For a complete set of instructions for working with TinyPass for WordPress, please visit www.developer.tinypass.com/main/wordpress.

= How do my visitors pay? =

TinyPass offers a quick and painless payment process that allows your visitors to use their preferred payment method (PayPal, Amazon, Google Wallet or Credit Card). There is no new account to create and no long form to fill out. Payment can be made in as little as two clicks, and visitors never leave your site during the payment process. 

= How do I get paid? =

You can track your sales and revenue in real-time in your TinyPass publisher dashboard and request payout per our terms of service, see https://tinypass.com/terms/publisher.

= What does it cost to use TinyPass? =

We pride ourselves on offering a unique and useful technology, great service, no startup cost, and a fair and transparent fee structure. We make money by deducting a small percentage of each transaction that is processed through TinyPass. Our system is purpose-built to maximize the revenue you earn while minimizing the fees you pay. In most cases, you'll get all of the services that TinyPass offers and still keep more revenue after fees than you would if you built your own system for processing transactions directly through PayPal, Amazon Payments, Google Checkout, or the major credit cards. For more on our fee structure, please visit https://tinypass.com/terms/publisher#transfees
